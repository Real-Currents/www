This site is about signs and symbols in motion; a showcase of
experiments in <a

class="external" target="_blank">Information Experience Design (IxD)</a>.
It’s purpose is to recognize and explore our need to turn what often
appears to be a tsunami or avalanche of data (waves) into familiar and
intuitive patterns (currents) which have direction, velocity and
stability (or meta-stability).

In terms of information and insight (wisdom):

- Is disruption a consequence or a cause of novel phenomena, or could it
  be both?
- Is the final impact of a tsunami to wreak havoc and destruction, or
  could it be…
  - the first phase of an unfolding wave of chain reactions which
    simultaneously…
    - transform the previous landscape
    - and give birth to a new environment?

Our interests lean toward producing and promoting methods for tracing
the potential path (locus) of these phenomena, from where they begin to
where they may lead, with an emphasis on interpretability, reasonability
and usability.
