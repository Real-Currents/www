title: "Real~Currents"

This site is about signs and symbols in motion; a showcase of
experiments in Information Experience Design (IxD). Itâ€™s purpose is to
recognize and explore our need to turn what often appears to be a
tsunami or avalanche of data (waves) into familiar and intuitive
patterns (currents) which have direction, velocity and stability (or
meta-stability).

In terms of information and insight (wisdom):

- Is disruption a consequence or a cause of novel phenomena, or can it
  be both?
- Is the inevitable impact of a tsunami to wreak havoc and destruction,
  or can it be the first phase of an unfolding wave of chain reactions
  which simultaneously transform the previous landscape and give birth
  to a new environment?

Our interests lean toward producing and promoting methods for tracing
the potential path (locus) of these phenomena, from where they begin to
where they may lead, with an emphasis on interpretability, reasonability
and usability.
