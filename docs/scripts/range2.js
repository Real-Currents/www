 *
 * This is a contructor function that initializes new Range objects. Note that the  
 * function does not create or return an object. It just initializes 'this'
 *
 * REV EDIT:
 * I'm defining the prototype property from within the Range function declaration,
 * just to make sure that works. If so, it seems like a cleaner class definition.
 * DOES NOT WORK, so apparently, defining a prototype prop is a bad idea because 
 * this object ALREADY exists and the constructor process overwrites any prototype 
 * that is defined within the constructor funciton. Rather, I will attempt to add
 * methods/properties to this previously generated prototype object... WORKS
 * END EDIT

     * methods because without that term, the method/function may
     * use the value that is stored in a property of the prototype
     * (CLASS) rather than the value stored in the INSTANCE property
